>Initial tests have been successfully carried out in muddy, gas-rich to stiff, coarse-grained sediments in lakes, estuaries, and on the marine shelf (North Sea) (for an example of a test protocol see Fig. 2).
Depending on the sediment and on the deployment velocity (winch speeds of 17 cm s -1 to free drop), the penetration depth ranges between 0.5 m (fine-grained sand) and 5 m (silty clay).
In the fine-grained sands, mounting of weight pieces results in an increase of penetration depth of ca. 20 cm per 15 kg weight. 
Pore pressure response was not affected by the additional weight during impact.

>In general, our results attest similar cone and sleeve resistance, and hence friction ratios as in standard CPTests, when comparing our sediment grain size analyses with the CPT results.
Soil classification following Robertson's chart (1) is applicable at low to moderate winch speeds, while high penetration rates (>80 cm s -1 ) and free-drop fail to provide meaningful results.
We suggest that additional high velocity testing is required to empirically adjust the classification for our instrument.

>Pore pressures generally rise during impact, but often show rapid decays towards ambient values during our dissipation tests.
We followed two different strategies during our longer tests aiming at pore pressure evolution: full penetration of the probe and dissipation times of several hours (Fig. 3a), and stepwise depth profiling and arresting the instrument at each level for about 10 mins (Fig. 3b).
As an example for strategy (A) , a 2 hr.-long dissipation test in Bremerhaven mud is presented.
The pore pressure evolution in Bremerhaven is characterized by a build-up soon after insertion (> 12 kPa), followed by a decay to half that value (t 50 ) after approximately one hour. 
Strategy (B) was followed during measurements in glacial and post-glacial clayey sediments of Lake Lucerne, Switzerland.
Interestingly, we observe a different behavior in the Holocene clays down to 340 cm penetration depth, and in the late glacial clays underneath.
In the hangingwall, pore pressure evolution during each measuring increment is characterized by an initial increase when lowering the instrument followed by a decay in the subsequent 10 minutes.
In contrast, the late glacial clays show a significant pore pressure drop when inserting the probe further, which in turn is followed by a continuous rise in pore pressure over the 10 min. period.
We attribute this change in pore pressure signal to overpressure in the footwall section, most likely due to the presence of gas.

>In summary, our initial tests have been demonstrated that the new FF-CPT instrument represents a flexible, cost-efficient way to carry out in situ geotechnical sediment characterization. 
Data are in general agreement with standard industry CPTesting, however, the device offers new opportunities for longer term deployments or use from small platforms and boats.

>During deployment, parameters such as cone resistance q c (as a measure for bearing strength), sleeve friction f s (as a measure for cohesion of the soil), pore pressure u in various positions (u 1 through u 3 , usually measured in excess of hydrostatic pressure; see Lunne et al., 1997), temperature, deceleration, and tilt are collected. The majority of the sensors are hosted in the 10 cm 2 or 15 cm 2 piezocone, which generally measures only about 30 cm in length. These cones are mounted to metal rods, coils, or free-fall lances. While the first are pushed at a constant rate of 2 cm/s (quasi-static mode) into the sediment, the latter can be deployed at any rate (usually depending on the speed of a winch or crane) up to free drop.
